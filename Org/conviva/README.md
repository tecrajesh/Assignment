Assignment
Design a react application to display customer information on the landing page.
Assignment has been broken down into three parts -
 Frontend UI
 Backend API&#39;s
 Database design
Sub-parts of each section has been annotated as mandatory/optional. Optional
assignments are good to have to demonstrate e2e functionality.
Requirements:
 Frontend: The landing page should have two containers with following
behaviour.
o Container 1: List of customers with each row showing customer basic
details - Customer Id, Name, Age, angular
o Container 2: On click of a customer row in container 1, container 2
should list all of customer’s addresses (customer may have 0 or more
addresses assigned to him/her)

 Backend (Optional): Use mock APIs if you are not familiar with API
development
o endpoint to fetch list of customers and basic details
o endpoint to fetch all customer addresses given a customer id
 Database (Optional) [Not required if using mock APIs]
o Store customer and address data in a database. Prepopulate
customers data in the database with seed data.

Expectations:
The application code must have all the layers that a mid-size enterprise project
would have.
 Frontend
o React
o state management (redux or similar)
o middleware (saga or similar)
 Backend (optional)
o any framework on any runtime
 Database (optional)

o Relational database (Preferred) or no SQL
 Unit Tests: Wherever applicable
 Modular and decoupled code
 Logging wherever applicable
 Solution should be hosted in GitHub or similar platform
